bug in error cases, instance sha1 isn't yet computed but used.
   one solution could be to use the id instead
use a temporary file for firmware downloads
create a input_validation module
pass a pointer to command handlers for retrieving an error message
allow to associate a "product type" to a firmware
implement all the TODOs in the source
only keep base_workspace, don't allow to change the others
Add an automated way to test the config and the AppArmor profile
automated cleanup mechanism in case of crash
install bash completion to /etc/bash_completion.d/
code cleanup / refactoring in instances.c
