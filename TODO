code cleanup / refactoring in instances.c

use the properties system for all the entities properties existing so far
add a SET command, generic setter for entity properties, and handle the list case
pass a pointer to command handlers for retrieving an error message
implement the PULL command, with libcurl
add a lua config file for each firmware
allow to associate a "product type" to a firmware
add a inotify watch on firmwares in the repository
implement all the TODOs in the source

only keep base_workspace, don't allow to change the others
